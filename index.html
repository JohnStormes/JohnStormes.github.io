            <p>
                our affinity diagram is a brainstorm board for ways to improve the system of attendance 
                subscriptions at universities. Firstly, an application needs to be made to account for 
                large amounts of students. Secondly, the university needs to be consulted and convinced to 
                apply the program. Thirdly, the program should expand beyond a single classroom or school. Also,
                attendance needs to be accounted for accurately without the possibility of absent students clocking
                in. Finally, pricing and cost need to be considered.

            Cody Kolodziejzyk is a young, tech savvy professor who wishes attendance was easier to track. He worked hard in university,
            and wishes his students would too. He can't stand students skipping and missing key information. As Cody once said,
            "these kids skip too much"
