            <p>
                our affinity diagram is a brainstorm board for ways to improve the system of attendance 
                subscriptions at universities. Firstly, an application needs to be made to account for 
                large amounts of students. Secondly, the university needs to be consulted and convinced to 
                apply the program. Thirdly, the program should expand beyond a single classroom or school. Also,
                attendance needs to be accounted for accurately without the possibility of absent students clocking
                in. Finally, pricing and cost need to be considered.

            Cody Kolodziejzyk is a young, tech savvy professor who wishes attendance was easier to track. He worked hard in university,
            and wishes his students would too. He can't stand students skipping and missing key information. As Cody once said,
            "these kids skip too much"

            Professor K has installed and implemented the new attendance app, and realizes as more students show up than 
            usual, that the anti-exploit attendance system allows for only in person students to sign in.
            knowing that they will be expelled from their school if they continue to skip, students all show up to class.

          <p>
          Our team sketches represent different visual concepts for our attendance application. The idea is that
          any given student can sign into their school's database, see their schedule based on the date and semester,
          and then sign into their class in person with a interactive sign in module. My sketch displays the log in
          screen, then the course selection screen, then the sign in screen.
